# DriverInterface

This year we will be making a driver interface. The basic description of this project is there is a CAN line running around the car. We will be taking data off that line. It should have oil pressure, fuel pressure, water temp, rpm, and more. The CAN line will connect to a CAN bus and raspberry pi in the dash. Then to display it we will need an screen. I would love to have the screen on the steering wheel. To do this it makes it a little more complcated. The screen will need a driver, power and a connection to the Rpi. The quick disconnect on the steerign column has 8? pins so that is not enough to use to transmit data to a display driver I think we will need to use a extra cable running to the steering wheel. Before you start this project I want to sit down with each of you and show what needs to be done, showing you is much easier than explaining here. I will tell you what I think may need to happen and what I did in the past, but I am giving you the freedom to design it your way and then tell me why it was desinged that way.
